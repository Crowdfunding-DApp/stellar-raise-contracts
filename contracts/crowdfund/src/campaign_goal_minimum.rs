// campaign_goal_minimum — Minimum threshold enforcement for campaign goals.
//
// Security Assumptions:
// 1. MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT >= 1 closes the zero-goal drain exploit.
// 2. Negative goals are rejected by the < MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT comparison.
// 3. No integer overflow — only comparisons and saturating_add are used.
// 4. validate_goal_amount is called before any env.storage() write.
// 5. Constants are baked into WASM; changes require a contract upgrade.

//! @title   CampaignGoalMinimum — Extracted constants and enforcement logic
//!          for campaign goal and minimum contribution threshold validation.
//!
//! @notice  This module centralizes every magic number and threshold used
//!          during campaign initialization and contribution validation.
//!          Extracting them into named constants eliminates repeated literals
//!          scattered across the contract, reduces the risk of inconsistent
//!          values, and makes the intent of each guard immediately clear to
//!          reviewers.
//!
//! @dev     All constants are `pub` so that `lib.rs` and test modules can
//!          import them from a single source of truth.  No runtime state is
//!          held here — this module is purely compile-time constants plus
//!          pure validation helpers.
//!
//! ## Gas-efficiency rationale
//!
//! Before this refactor the contract contained inline literals such as
//! `10_000` (fee cap in bps), `0` (zero-amount guard), and the minimum-goal
//! floor.  Each occurrence forced the reader to infer intent from context and
//! made audits error-prone.  Named constants:
//!
//! - Are resolved at compile time — zero runtime cost.
//! - Appear in a single place, so a future change touches one line.
//! - Enable the compiler to catch type mismatches at the call site.
//!
//! ## Security assumptions
//!
//! 1. `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT` prevents campaigns with a zero or trivially small
//!    goal that could be exploited to immediately trigger "goal reached" and
//!    allow the creator to withdraw dust amounts.
//! 2. `MIN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT` prevents zero-amount contributions that waste
//!    gas on a no-op token transfer and pollute the contributors list.
//! 3. `MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_BPS` caps the platform fee at 100 % (10 000 bps) so
//!    the contract can never be configured to steal all contributor funds.
//! 4. `PROGRESS_BPS_SCALE` is the single authoritative scale factor for all
//!    basis-point progress calculations; using it everywhere prevents
//!    off-by-one errors when the scale changes.
//! 5. `MIN_DEADLINE_OFFSET` ensures the campaign deadline is always in the
//!    future relative to the ledger timestamp at initialization, preventing
//!    campaigns that are dead-on-arrival.
//!
//! ## Validation flow
//!

//! @title   CampaignGoalMinimum — Enforces minimum campaign goal thresholds.
//!
//! @notice  This module provides all validation helpers for campaign creation
//!          parameters: goal amount, minimum contribution, deadline, and
//!          platform fee. It also exposes a progress-in-basis-points helper
//!          used by the frontend and indexers.
//!
//! @dev     All validators are `#[inline]` pure functions with no side-effects.
//!          They are called inside `initialize()` before any storage writes so
//!          that a rejected parameter leaves no partial ledger state.
//!
//! ## Security rationale
//!
//! | Threat | Mitigation |
//! |--------|-----------|
//! | Zero-goal drain | `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT = 1` rejects goals that would make a campaign immediately "successful" |
//! | Ledger spam | Non-zero minimum prevents dust campaigns that waste storage |
//! | Negative goal | `i128` comparison rejects all values < 1 in a single branch |
//! | Fee overflow | `MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_BPS = 10_000` caps fee at 100% |
//! | Deadline bypass | `MIN_DEADLINE_OFFSET` ensures campaigns run for at least 60 s |
//! | Progress overflow | `compute_progress_bps` uses `saturating_mul` and caps at `MAX_PROGRESS_BPS` |
