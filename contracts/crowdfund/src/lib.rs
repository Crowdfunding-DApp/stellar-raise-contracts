    // ── Multisig & DAO Compatibility ───────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // IMPORTANT: This contract fully supports multi-signature wallets and DAO
    // contracts as the campaign creator. The Soroban `Address` type can represent
    // both standard user accounts and contract addresses.
    //
    // When `creator.require_auth()` is called:
    // - For user accounts: Standard signature verification is performed
    // - For contract addresses: The contract's authorization logic is invoked,
    //   allowing multisig wallets, DAO governance contracts, or any custom
    //   authorization scheme to control the campaign
    //
    // All creator-restricted functions (withdraw, set_paused, update_metadata,
    // add_roadmap_item, add_stretch_goal, add_reward_tier, update_deadline,
    // post_update, add_to_whitelist) work seamlessly with multisig creators.
    //
    // Security Benefits:
    // - Eliminates single point of failure for high-value campaigns
    // - Enables decentralized governance of campaign operations
    // - Supports time-locked or threshold-based authorization schemes
    //
    // Example Multisig Patterns:
    // 1. M-of-N Threshold: Require M signatures out of N authorized signers
    // 2. DAO Governance: Require on-chain voting approval for admin actions
    // 3. Time-locked Admin: Require time delay before executing sensitive operations
    // 4. Hierarchical Control: Different authorization levels for different operations
    //
    // ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    /// In Soroban, the Address type abstracts over both account and contract

    /// runtime, the authorization mechanism (`require_auth()`) handles both
    /// cases transparently. This helper is provided for documentation purposes

        // For actual runtime checks, you would need to:
        // 1. Attempt to invoke a known contract function (will fail for accounts)
