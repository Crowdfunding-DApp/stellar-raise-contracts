# React Submit Button Component States

## Purpose

`react_submit_button.tsx` provides a scalable submit-button state model that standardizes behavior across forms and workflows.

It focuses on:

- predictable state mapping
- accessibility defaults
- safer label handling
- easy extensibility for future states

## File locations

- Component: `frontend/components/react_submit_button.tsx`
- Tests: `frontend/components/react_submit_button.test.tsx`

## State model

The component supports a strict state union:
`react_submit_button.tsx` centralizes submit-button state behavior to improve security and reliability in form workflows.

Goals:

- prevent accidental duplicate submissions
- enforce deterministic state transitions
- normalize and bound labels from possibly untrusted sources
- keep behavior accessible and easy to audit

## File Locations

- Component contract and implementation: `frontend/components/react_submit_button.tsx`
- Comprehensive tests: `frontend/components/react_submit_button.test.tsx`

## State Model

Supported states are strictly typed:

- `idle`
- `submitting`
- `success`
- `error`
- `disabled`

This ensures only approved states are used in consuming code and avoids ad-hoc string behavior.

## Security assumptions and safeguards

### Assumptions

- Labels may originate from untrusted sources (for example, API-driven copy or admin configuration).
- Consumers should not pass raw HTML into UI APIs.

### Safeguards implemented

1. **Text-only rendering path**  
   Labels are rendered as normal React string children. React escapes these values by default, reducing XSS risk when strings include markup-like text.

2. **Label normalization and fallback**  
   Empty or whitespace-only labels are rejected and replaced with known defaults, preventing blank CTA states.

3. **Label length bounding**  
   Labels are capped to 80 characters to prevent visual abuse and accidental layout breaks.

4. **State-based disable guard**  
   Click handling is removed when state is `submitting` or `disabled`, reducing duplicate submissions.

5. **Accessibility signaling**  
   `aria-busy` is enabled only while submitting; `aria-live="polite"` allows assistive technologies to announce state text changes.

## Usage example

### Overview

The `ReactSubmitButton` component provides a standardized submit button with consistent states for testing and developer experience. It implements idle, loading, disabled, and variant states, and prevents double-submit when loading.

### Purpose

- **Testing**: Predictable states (`idle`, `loading`, `disabled`) for reliable unit and integration tests.
- **Developer experience**: Simple API, typed props, and clear defaults.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, keyboard support, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Security**: Form semantics (`type="submit"`), no injection via children.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | — | Button label (required). |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | `false` | When true, shows spinner and prevents click (double-submit prevention). |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Explicit disabled state (e.g. form validation). |
| `variant` | `"primary" \| "secondary" \| "danger" \| "outline"` | `"primary"` | Visual variant matching Forms.css. |
| `fullWidth` | `boolean` | `false` | Full-width layout. |
| `loadingLabel` | `string` | `"Loading..."` | Accessible label when loading. |
| `form` | `string` | — | Form id to associate with (optional). |
| `className` | `string` | `""` | Additional CSS classes. |
| `onClick` | `(e) => void` | — | Click handler (not called when disabled or loading). |

---

## States

| State | Condition | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **idle** | `!isLoading && !disabled` | Clickable, shows `children`. |
| **loading** | `isLoading` | Disabled, shows spinner + `loadingLabel`, `aria-busy="true"`. |
| **disabled** | `disabled` | Disabled, shows `children`. |

---

## Usage
A transition map enforces allowed movement between states when `strictTransitions` is enabled.

## Security Assumptions

1. Label overrides may originate from untrusted input (CMS, API payloads, operator configuration).
2. React string rendering is used and no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` path is exposed.
3. Consumers may attempt invalid state jumps under race conditions.

## Security and Reliability Safeguards

1. Label normalization rejects non-string values and empty strings.
2. Control characters are removed and whitespace is normalized.
3. Labels are truncated to 80 characters to reduce layout abuse.
4. Invalid state transitions are rejected in strict mode by falling back to the previous valid state.
5. Interaction is blocked while submitting or locally in-flight to reduce double-submit risk.
6. `aria-busy` and `aria-live` semantics are set for assistive technology reliability.

## Usage Example

```tsx
import ReactSubmitButton from "../components/react_submit_button";

<ReactSubmitButton
  state="submitting"
  previousState="idle"
  strictTransitions
  type="submit"
  labels={{ idle: "Create Campaign", submitting: "Creating..." }}
  onClick={handleCreate}
/>;
```

## Testing coverage

`react_submit_button.test.tsx` validates:

- default labels per state
- custom label overrides
- fallback behavior for invalid labels
- long-label truncation edge case
- hostile label string handling assumptions
- disabled-state logic
- busy-state logic

## Review notes

- The component exports pure helper functions (`resolveSubmitButtonLabel`, `isSubmitButtonDisabled`, `isSubmitButtonBusy`) to keep tests deterministic and lightweight.
- Styling is state-mapped via a single lookup table to make future variants easy to add and review.
// Basic
<ReactSubmitButton>Submit</ReactSubmitButton>

// Loading state
<ReactSubmitButton isLoading>Submit</ReactSubmitButton>

// With form
<form id="campaign-form">
  {/* fields */}
</form>
<ReactSubmitButton form="campaign-form">Create Campaign</ReactSubmitButton>

// Variants
<ReactSubmitButton variant="secondary">Cancel</ReactSubmitButton>
<ReactSubmitButton variant="danger">Delete</ReactSubmitButton>
<ReactSubmitButton variant="outline" fullWidth>Submit</ReactSubmitButton>
```

## Security Assumptions

1. **type="submit"**: Enforced for form semantics; not overridable.
2. **Double-submit prevention**: When `isLoading`, button is disabled and `onClick` is not attached.
3. **Children**: Rendered as React nodes; avoid passing unsanitized user input.

## Testing

Run tests:

```bash
npm test -- react_submit_button
```

```bash
npm test -- react_submit_button --coverage --collectCoverageFrom="frontend/components/react_submit_button.tsx"

## Security Notes

- Uses `type="submit"` for correct form semantics.
- Prevents double-submit by disabling and omitting `onClick` when `isLoading`.
- No direct HTML injection; children are React nodes.

## Security Notes for Reviewers

- Hostile strings are intentionally preserved as plain text labels to rely on React escaping semantics.
- The component does not expose raw HTML rendering APIs.
- If future requirements need rich text labels, add explicit sanitization before rendering.
