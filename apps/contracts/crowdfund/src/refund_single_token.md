# `refund_single` — Pull-Based Token Refund

## Overview

`refund_single` is the preferred refund mechanism for the crowdfund contract.
It replaces the deprecated batch `refund()` function with a pull-based model
where each contributor independently claims their own refund.

## Why pull-based?

The old `refund()` iterated over every contributor in a single transaction.
On a campaign with many contributors this is unsafe:

- **Unbounded gas**: iteration cost grows linearly with contributor count.
- **Denial of service**: a single bad actor could bloat the contributors list
  to make the batch refund prohibitively expensive.
- **Poor composability**: scripts and automation cannot easily retry partial
  failures.

`refund_single` processes exactly one contributor per call, so gas costs are
constant and predictable regardless of campaign size.

## Function Signature

```rust
pub fn refund_single(env: Env, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

### Arguments

| Parameter     | Type      | Description                                      |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `contributor` | `Address` | The address claiming the refund (must be caller) |

### Return value

`Ok(())` on success, or one of the errors below.

### Errors

| Error                                | Condition                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContractError::CampaignStillActive` | Deadline has not yet passed                               |
| `ContractError::GoalReached`         | Campaign goal was met — no refunds available              |
| `ContractError::NothingToRefund`     | Caller has no contribution on record (or already claimed) |

### Panics

- `"campaign is not active"` — campaign status is `Successful` or `Cancelled`.

## Security Model

1. **Authentication** — `contributor.require_auth()` is called first. Only the
   contributor themselves can trigger their own refund.

2. **Direction Lock** — The token transfer explicitly uses the contract's address
   as the sender and the contributor as the recipient. This prevents parameter-order
   typos and ensures the direction cannot be reversed by a caller.

3. **Checks-Effects-Interactions** — The contribution record is zeroed in
   storage _before_ the token transfer is executed. This prevents re-entrancy
   and double-claim attacks even if the token contract calls back into the
   crowdfund contract.

4. **Overflow protection** — `total_raised` is decremented with `checked_sub`,
   panicking on underflow rather than silently wrapping.

5. **Status guard** — `Successful` and `Cancelled` campaigns are explicitly
   rejected. A `Refunded` campaign (set by the deprecated batch path) is
   allowed so that any contributor not swept by the batch can still claim.

## Security Invariants

These invariants are enforced by `validate_refund_preconditions` and
`execute_refund_single`, and are exercised directly by
`refund_single_token_security_tests.rs`:

| Invariant                                                                         | Enforcement                                                                                                                       | Test                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A backer cannot refund twice                                                      | The contribution record is zeroed before transfer; a second call reads `0` and returns `NothingToRefund`                          | `test_double_refund_rejected`                            |
| Refund is rejected while the campaign is `Active` and the deadline has not passed | `validate_refund_preconditions` returns `CampaignStillActive`                                                                     | `test_refund_rejected_while_active`                      |
| Refund is rejected once the campaign is `Successful`                              | `validate_refund_preconditions` panics with `"campaign is not active"` — the creator withdraws instead                            | `test_refund_rejected_when_successful`                   |
| A non-contributor cannot refund                                                   | Stored contribution defaults to `0`, returning `NothingToRefund`                                                                  | `test_refund_rejected_for_non_contributor`               |
| The refund amount cannot be forged                                                | `execute_refund_single` reads the amount to refund from storage itself; it no longer accepts a caller-supplied `amount` parameter | `test_execute_refund_single_derives_amount_from_storage` |
| No dust is left behind once every backer has claimed                              | After all contributors call `refund_single`, the contract's token balance and `total_raised` both reach exactly `0`               | `test_all_backers_refunded_leaves_zero_contract_balance` |

## Events

On success, the following event is emitted:

```
topic:  ("campaign", "refund_single")
data:   (contributor: Address, amount: i128)
```

Off-chain indexers and scripts should listen for this event to track refund
activity without polling storage.

## Deprecation of `refund()`

The batch `refund()` function is **deprecated** as of contract v3. It remains
callable for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future upgrade.

Migration checklist for scripts and frontends:

- [ ] Remove any call to `refund()`.
- [ ] For each contributor, call `refund_single(contributor)` instead.
- [ ] Handle `NothingToRefund` gracefully (contributor already claimed or
      was never a contributor).
- [ ] Listen for `("campaign", "refund_single")` events instead of
      `("campaign", "refunded")`.

# refund_single_token — Single-Contributor Token Refund Logic

## Overview

This module documents, isolates, and tests the `refund_single` token transfer
pattern used inside the `CrowdfundContract::refund()` and `cancel()` bulk loops.

The core operation is simple: read a contributor's stored balance, transfer it
back from the contract to the contributor, then zero the record to prevent a
double-refund. By extracting this into a named, documented function the logic
becomes independently testable and auditable.

---

## Why This Module Exists

The original `refund()` function performed the token transfer inline inside a
`for` loop with no inline comments, making it hard to:

- Reason about the storage-mutation ordering (read → transfer → zero)
- Verify double-refund prevention
- Test the single-contributor path in isolation
- Audit the security assumptions around re-entrancy

This module addresses all four points.

## Token Transfer Flow

                                   ┌────┴────┐
                                  YES        NO
                                   │          └─► return 0 (no-op)
                                   ▼
                         token_client.transfer(
                           from  = contract_address,
                           to    = contributor,

                         set Contribution(contributor) = 0
                         extend_ttl(contribution_key, 100, 100)

## API

### `refund_single(env, token_address, contributor) -> i128`

Transfers the contributor's stored balance back to them and zeroes the record.

| Parameter       | Type       | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `env`           | `&Env`     | Soroban execution environment                  |
| `token_address` | `&Address` | Token contract address (set at initialisation) |
| `contributor`   | `&Address` | The contributor to refund                      |
| **returns**     | `i128`     | Amount refunded (0 if nothing was owed)        |

### `get_contribution(env, contributor) -> i128`

Read-only query of a contributor's stored balance. Returns 0 if the key is
absent (never contributed or already refunded).

---

## Security Assumptions

1. **Contract holds the tokens** — The contract must hold at least `amount`
   tokens before `refund_single` is called. This is guaranteed by the
   `contribute()` function which transfers tokens in before recording them.

2. **Storage-before-transfer ordering** — The contribution record is zeroed
   _after_ the token transfer succeeds. If the transfer panics (e.g. the
   token contract rejects it), the entire transaction is rolled back and the
   record remains intact — no funds are lost.

3. **Double-refund prevention** — Because the record is zeroed after the first
   successful transfer, a second call for the same contributor is a no-op
   (returns 0, emits no transfer).

4. **Zero-amount skip** — Contributors with a zero balance are skipped without
   a cross-contract call, saving gas and keeping the event log clean.

5. **Token address immutability** — The token client is always constructed from
   the address stored at initialisation. A caller cannot substitute a
   different token contract.

6. **No overflow** — `amount` is an `i128` read directly from storage. It was
   validated at contribution time (checked_add) so it cannot exceed the total
   tokens held by the contract.

# `refund_single` — Pull-Based Token Refund

## Overview

`refund_single` is the preferred refund mechanism for the crowdfund contract.
It replaces the deprecated batch `refund()` function with a pull-based model
where each contributor independently claims their own refund.

## Why pull-based?

The old `refund()` iterated over every contributor in a single transaction.
On a campaign with many contributors this is unsafe:

- **Unbounded gas**: iteration cost grows linearly with contributor count.
- **Denial of service**: a single bad actor could bloat the contributors list
  to make the batch refund prohibitively expensive.
- **Poor composability**: scripts and automation cannot easily retry partial
  failures.

`refund_single` processes exactly one contributor per call, so gas costs are
constant and predictable regardless of campaign size.

## Function Signature

```rust
pub fn refund_single(env: Env, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

### Arguments

| Parameter     | Type      | Description                                      |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `contributor` | `Address` | The address claiming the refund (must be caller) |

### Return value

`Ok(())` on success, or one of the errors below.

### Errors

| Error                                | Condition                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContractError::CampaignStillActive` | Deadline has not yet passed                               |
| `ContractError::GoalReached`         | Campaign goal was met — no refunds available              |
| `ContractError::NothingToRefund`     | Caller has no contribution on record (or already claimed) |

### Panics

- `"campaign is not active"` — campaign status is `Successful` or `Cancelled`.

## Security Model

1. **Authentication** — `contributor.require_auth()` is called first. Only the
   contributor themselves can trigger their own refund.

2. **Direction Lock** — The token transfer explicitly uses the contract's address
   as the sender and the contributor as the recipient. This prevents parameter-order
   typos and ensures the direction cannot be reversed by a caller.

3. **Direction Lock** — The token transfer explicitly uses the contract's address
   as the sender and the contributor as the recipient. This prevents parameter-order
   typos and ensures the direction cannot be reversed by a caller.

4. **Checks-Effects-Interactions** — The contribution record is zeroed in
5. **Checks-Effects-Interactions** — The contribution record is zeroed in
   storage _before_ the token transfer is executed. This prevents re-entrancy
   and double-claim attacks even if the token contract calls back into the
   crowdfund contract.

6. **Overflow protection** — `total_raised` is decremented with `checked_sub`,
   panicking on underflow rather than silently wrapping.

7. **Status guard** — `Successful` and `Cancelled` campaigns are explicitly
8. **Overflow protection** — `total_raised` is decremented with `checked_sub`,
   panicking on underflow rather than silently wrapping.

9. **Status guard** — `Successful` and `Cancelled` campaigns are explicitly
   rejected. A `Refunded` campaign (set by the deprecated batch path) is
   allowed so that any contributor not swept by the batch can still claim.

## Events

On success, the following event is emitted:

```
topic:  ("campaign", "refund_single")
data:   (contributor: Address, amount: i128)
```

Off-chain indexers and scripts should listen for this event to track refund
activity without polling storage.

## Deprecation of `refund()`

The batch `refund()` function is **deprecated** as of contract v3. It remains
callable for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future upgrade.

Migration checklist for scripts and frontends:

- [ ] Remove any call to `refund()`.
- [ ] For each contributor, call `refund_single(contributor)` instead.
- [ ] Handle `NothingToRefund` gracefully (contributor already claimed or
      was never a contributor).
- [ ] Listen for `("campaign", "refund_single")` events instead of
      `("campaign", "refunded")`.

## Storage Layout

| Key                           | Storage    | Type   | Description                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `DataKey::Contribution(addr)` | Persistent | `i128` | Per-contributor balance; zeroed on claim |
| `DataKey::TotalRaised`        | Instance   | `i128` | Global total; decremented on each claim  |

## Test Coverage

### `refund_single_token.test.rs` — unit tests for module internals

- Basic single-contributor refund
- Multi-contributor independent claims
- Incremental `total_raised` accounting
- Accumulated contributions (multiple `contribute` calls)
- Double-claim prevention (`NothingToRefund`)
- Zero-contribution guard
- Deadline boundary (at deadline vs. past deadline)
- Goal-reached guard (exact and exceeded)
- Campaign status guards (`Successful`, `Cancelled`)
- Auth enforcement
- Interaction with deprecated batch `refund()`
- Platform fee isolation (fee does not affect refund amount)
- Contribution record zeroed after claim
- Partial claims (other contributors unaffected)
- Minimum contribution boundary
  Tests `validate_refund_preconditions` and `execute_refund_single` directly
  via `env.as_contract`, covering:

### `refund_single_token_tests.rs` — integration tests via contract client

Tests the full `refund_single` contract method end-to-end, covering:
basic refund, multi-contributor, accumulated contributions, double-claim,
zero-contribution, deadline boundary, goal-reached, campaign status guards,
auth enforcement, interaction with deprecated `refund()`, platform fee
isolation, contribution record zeroing, partial claims, and minimum amount.
