//! Bounded `withdraw()` Event Emission Module
//!
//! Centralises all event publishing for the `withdraw()` function.
//! Three validated helpers replace scattered inline `env.events().publish()`
//! calls, preventing silent emission of zero-fee or zero-payout events that

//! ## Optimisation
//!
//! The original implementation emitted one `nft_minted` event per contributor

//! summary event (O(1)), capping gas consumption regardless of contributor count.

//! # Withdraw Event Emission Module
//!
//! Provides security-hardened helpers for emitting events during the
//! `withdraw()` lifecycle. All event emission is centralised here so that
//! the main contract function stays readable and every event payload is
//! validated in one place.
//!
//! ## Events emitted by `withdraw()`
//!
//! | Topic 1    | Topic 2            | Data                   | Condition                          |
//! |------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
//! | `campaign` | `fee_transferred`  | `(Address, i128)`      | Platform fee is configured         |
//! | `campaign` | `nft_batch_minted` | `u32`                  | NFT contract set and ≥1 mint done  |
//! | `campaign` | `withdrawn`        | `(Address, i128, u32)` | Always on successful withdraw      |
//!
//! ## Security assumptions
//!
//! * All amounts are validated to be non-negative before emission.
//! * The `withdrawn` event is emitted **after** state mutation (status set to
//!   `Successful`, `TotalRaised` zeroed) so off-chain indexers observe a
//!   consistent final state.
//! * `emit_fee_transferred` is only called when `fee > 0` to prevent
//!   misleading zero-fee events.
//! * `emit_nft_batch_minted` is only called when `minted_count > 0`.
//! * `emit_withdrawn` always fires exactly once per successful `withdraw()`
//!   invocation — callers must not call it more than once.

//! Bounded `withdraw()` Event Emission Module
//!
//! Provides three focused emit helpers and bounded NFT minting for the
//! crowdfund contract's `withdraw()` function.
//!
//! ## Security Invariants
//!
//! - [`emit_fee_transferred`] panics if `fee <= 0` — prevents silent zero-fee events.
//! - [`emit_nft_batch_minted`] panics if `minted_count == 0` — callers must guard.
//! - [`emit_withdrawn`] panics if `creator_payout <= 0` — prevents zero-payout withdrawals.
//! Optimized `withdraw()` Event Emission Module
//!
//! Centralises all event publishing for the `withdraw()` function into three
//! validated helper functions. Each helper asserts its invariants before
//! publishing, so a logic error upstream causes an explicit panic rather than
//! a silently misleading event on-chain.
//!
//! ## Design Goals
//!
//! | Goal | Mechanism |
//! |------|-----------|
//! | Gas efficiency | Single `nft_batch_minted` event instead of O(n) per-contributor events |
//! | Readability | Named helpers replace scattered `env.events().publish(…)` calls |
//! | Security | Positive-only assertions on every monetary amount |
//! | Testability | Each helper is independently unit-testable |
//!
//! ## Events Published
//!
//! | Topic 1    | Topic 2            | Data                        | Condition |
//! |------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
//! | `campaign` | `fee_transferred`  | `(Address, i128)`           | Platform fee > 0 |
//! | `campaign` | `nft_batch_minted` | `u32`                       | At least 1 NFT minted |
//! | `campaign` | `withdrawn`        | `(Address, i128, u32)`      | Always on success |
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! [`mint_nfts_in_batch`] caps NFT minting at [`MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH`] per call,
//! bounding gas consumption and emitting a single summary event instead of O(n).
//! Centralises all event publishing for the `withdraw()` function.
//! Three validated helpers replace scattered inline `env.events().publish()`
//! calls, preventing silent emission of zero-fee or zero-payout events that
//! would mislead off-chain indexers.
//!
//! ## Optimisation
//!
//! The original implementation emitted one `nft_minted` event per contributor
//! (O(n) events). This module replaces that with a single `nft_batch_minted`
//! summary event (O(1)), capping gas consumption regardless of contributor count.
//!
//! ## Events emitted
//!
//! | Topic 2            | Data                   | Condition                          |
