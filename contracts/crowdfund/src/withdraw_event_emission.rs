//! Bounded `withdraw()` Event Emission Module
//!
//! @title   WithdrawEventEmission — Validated event helpers for `withdraw()`
//! @notice  Centralises all event publishing for the `withdraw()` function.
//!          Three validated helpers replace scattered inline `env.events().publish()`
//!          calls, preventing silent emission of zero-fee or zero-payout events
//!          that would mislead off-chain indexers.
//!
//! @dev     All helpers are pure with respect to contract storage — they only
//!          call `env.events().publish()`.  Each helper validates its inputs
//!          and panics on invalid arguments so callers cannot accidentally emit
//!          misleading events.
//!
//! ## Performance improvement
//!
//! The original implementation emitted one `nft_minted` event per contributor
//! (O(n) events). This module replaces that with a single `nft_batch_minted`
//! summary event (O(1)), capping gas consumption regardless of contributor count.
//!
//! ## Developer-experience improvements
//!
//! - Each helper returns a typed `EventPayload` describing what was emitted,
//!   so unit tests can assert on the return value without scanning `env.events()`.
//! - `emit_fee_transferred` now includes `fee_bps` in the event data so
//!   off-chain indexers can verify the fee rate without re-reading storage.
//! - All panics carry descriptive messages for easier debugging.
//!
//! ## Events emitted
//!
//! | Topic 2            | Data                        | Condition                          |
//! |--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
//! | `fee_transferred`  | `(Address, i128, u32)`      | Platform fee > 0                   |
//! | `nft_batch_minted` | `u32`                       | NFT contract set, minted_count > 0 |
//! | `withdrawn`        | `(Address, i128, u32)`      | Always on successful withdraw      |
//!
//! ## Security Assumptions
//!
//! 1. **No storage writes** — helpers only call `env.events().publish()`.
//! 2. **Input validation** — all helpers panic on invalid inputs.
//! 3. **Overflow-safe** — NFT batch loop uses a hard cap (`MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH`).
//! 4. **Bounded** — `mint_nfts_in_batch` iterates at most `MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH` times.
