# `crowdfund_initialize_function` — Optimized Initialize Logic
# `crowdfund_initialize_function` — Refactored Initialize Logic

## Overview

`crowdfund_initialize_function` extracts and standardizes the `initialize()`
logic from `lib.rs` into a single, auditable module with performance optimizations.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Early Validation Exit
Uses `?` operator for short-circuit error propagation instead of nested `if let Err` blocks:

```rust
// Before (nested)
if let Err(e) = validate_goal(params.goal) {
    return Err(e);
}

// After (short-circuit)
validate_goal(params.goal)?;
```

### 2. Inline Hints
Validation helpers are marked `#[inline]` to allow the compiler to specialize call sites:

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn validate_bonus_goal(bonus_goal: Option<i128>, goal: i128) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Batched Validation
All parameter checks run in a single `validate_init_params()` call:

```rust
pub fn validate_init_params(env: &Env, params: &InitParams) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    validate_goal(params.goal)?;
    validate_min_contribution(params.min_contribution)?;
    validate_deadline(env.ledger().timestamp(), params.deadline)?;
    if let Some(ref config) = params.platform_config {
        validate_platform_fee(config.fee_bps)?;
    }
    validate_bonus_goal(params.bonus_goal, params.goal)?;
    validate_bonus_goal_description(&params.bonus_goal_description)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### 4. Optimized Storage Writes
All required storage writes are grouped together with only necessary conditional writes for optional fields.

### 5. Single Sentinel Check
Uses a single `has()` check on `DataKey::Creator` as the initialization sentinel:

```rust
if env.storage().instance().has(&DataKey::Creator) {
    return Err(ContractError::AlreadyInitialized);
}
```
logic from `lib.rs` into a single, auditable module.  It provides:

- A named `InitParams` struct replacing nine positional arguments.
- Pure validation helpers returning typed `ContractError` variants.
- A deterministic, single-pass `execute_initialize()` function with a strict
  checks → effects → storage write ordering.
- An `initialized` event payload for off-chain indexers.
- Helper functions (`describe_init_error`, `is_init_error_retryable`) for
  frontend error handling.

---

## Design Decisions

### Named `InitParams` struct

The original `initialize()` accepted nine positional arguments. Positional
lists are fragile: swapping two `i128` parameters compiles silently but
produces incorrect on-chain state. A named struct makes every field explicit
The original `initialize()` accepted nine positional arguments.  Positional
lists are fragile: swapping two `i128` parameters compiles silently but
produces incorrect on-chain state.  A named struct makes every field explicit
at the call site and lets the compiler catch type mismatches.

### Typed errors instead of panics

The original implementation panicked on invalid platform fee and bonus goal.
Panics are opaque to the frontend — the Soroban SDK surfaces them as a generic
host error with no numeric code. Typed `ContractError` variants let the
host error with no numeric code.  Typed `ContractError` variants let the
frontend display a specific message without parsing error strings.

| New variant | Code | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `InvalidGoal` | 8 | `goal < 1` |
| `InvalidMinContribution` | 9 | `min_contribution < 1` |
| `DeadlineTooSoon` | 10 | `deadline < now + 60` |
| `InvalidPlatformFee` | 11 | `fee_bps > 10_000` |
| `InvalidBonusGoal` | 12 | `bonus_goal <= goal` |
| `InvalidBonusGoalDescription` | 13 | Description too long |

### Validate-before-write ordering

The original code interleaved validation and storage writes. If a later
validation failed after earlier writes had already committed, the contract
could be left in a partially-initialized state. `execute_initialize()` runs

### Validate-before-write ordering

The original code interleaved validation and storage writes.  If a later
validation failed after earlier writes had already committed, the contract
could be left in a partially-initialized state.  `execute_initialize()` runs
all validations first, then writes atomically within the transaction.

### `initialized` event

Soroban storage is not directly queryable by off-chain services without an RPC
call per field. The `initialized` event carries all campaign parameters in a
call per field.  The `initialized` event carries all campaign parameters in a
single ledger entry, enabling indexers to bootstrap campaign state from the
event stream alone.

---

## Function Reference

### `execute_initialize(env, params) → Result<(), ContractError>`

The single authoritative implementation of campaign initialization.
`CrowdfundContract::initialize()` in `lib.rs` delegates to this function.

**Ordering guarantee:**
1. Re-initialization guard (read-only check on `DataKey::Creator`).
2. `creator.require_auth()` — authentication before any state mutation.
3. Full parameter validation — no storage writes until all checks pass.
4. Storage writes — all-or-nothing within the transaction.
5. Event emission — `("campaign", "initialized")`.

### `validate_init_params(env, params) → Result<(), ContractError>`

Runs all field validations in a single pass. Delegates to the helpers in
Runs all field validations in a single pass.  Delegates to the helpers in
`campaign_goal_minimum` for goal, min_contribution, deadline, and platform fee,
and to `validate_bonus_goal` for the bonus goal ordering constraint.

### `validate_bonus_goal(bonus_goal, goal) → Result<(), ContractError>`

Returns `Ok(())` when `bonus_goal` is `None` or strictly greater than `goal`.
Returns `Err(ContractError::InvalidBonusGoal)` otherwise.

### `log_initialize(env, creator, token, goal, deadline, min_contribution)`

Emits a single bounded `("campaign", "initialized")` event with a fixed-size
scalar payload. Only the five core scalar fields are included — optional strings
such as `bonus_goal_description` are intentionally excluded to keep event size
O(1) regardless of input length.

**Gas efficiency**: a single event with a 5-field tuple costs a fixed amount of
gas. Including unbounded strings would make event cost proportional to string
length, creating a gas griefing vector.

**Event data**: `(Address, Address, i128, u64, i128)` — `(creator, token, goal, deadline, min_contribution)`.

### `describe_init_error(code) → &'static str`

Maps a `ContractError` repr value to a human-readable string. Intended for
### `describe_init_error(code) → &'static str`

Maps a `ContractError` repr value to a human-readable string.  Intended for
frontend error display.

### `is_init_error_retryable(code) → bool`

Returns `true` for input validation errors (codes 8–12) that the caller can
fix and retry. Returns `false` for `AlreadyInitialized` (code 1), which is
fix and retry.  Returns `false` for `AlreadyInitialized` (code 1), which is
permanent.

## Frontend Interaction

1. Construct the `initialize` transaction with all required parameters.
1. Construct the `initialize` transaction with all nine parameters.
2. On success, listen for the `("campaign", "initialized")` event to confirm
   the campaign is live and cache the emitted parameters locally.
3. On failure, read the returned error code and call `describe_init_error(code)`
   to display a user-facing message.
4. Use `is_init_error_retryable(code)` to decide whether to show a "try again"
   button or a permanent failure message.

```typescript
// TypeScript / Stellar SDK example
try {
  await contract.initialize({ admin, creator, token, goal, deadline, ... });
} catch (e) {
  const code = extractContractErrorCode(e); // SDK-specific helper
  const message = describeInitError(code);  // replicate describe_init_error
  const retryable = isInitErrorRetryable(code);
  showError(message, { retryable });
}

// Replicate describe_init_error in TypeScript
function describeInitError(code: number): string {
  const messages: Record<number, string> = {
    1:  "Contract is already initialized",
    8:  "Campaign goal must be at least 1",
    9:  "Minimum contribution must be at least 1",
    10: "Deadline must be at least 60 seconds in the future",
    11: "Platform fee cannot exceed 100% (10,000 bps)",
    12: "Bonus goal must be strictly greater than the primary goal",
  };
  return messages[code] ?? "Unknown initialization error";
}

function isInitErrorRetryable(code: number): boolean {
  return [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].includes(code);
}
# `initialize` — Crowdfund Contract

Initializes a new crowdfunding campaign. Must be called exactly once after deployment.

---

## Signature

```rust
pub fn initialize(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    creator: Address,
    token: Address,
    goal: i128,
    deadline: u64,
    min_contribution: i128,
    platform_config: Option<PlatformConfig>,
    bonus_goal: Option<i128>,
    bonus_goal_description: Option<String>,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

---

## Scalability Considerations

- `initialize()` is a one-shot function; its gas cost is O(1) regardless of
  future campaign size.
- The `Contributors` and `Roadmap` lists are seeded as empty vectors. Their
- The `Contributors` and `Roadmap` lists are seeded as empty vectors.  Their
  TTL is managed by `contribute()` and `add_roadmap_item()` respectively.
- The `initialized` event payload is bounded: it contains only scalar values
  and optional scalars, never unbounded collections.
- The `InitParams` struct can be extended with new optional fields in future
  versions without breaking existing callers (new fields default to `None`).

---

## Security Assumptions

1. **Re-initialization guard** — `DataKey::Creator` is used as the
   initialization sentinel. It is the very first check so no state can be
   written before it.

2. **Creator authentication** — `creator.require_auth()` is called before any
   storage write. The Soroban host rejects the transaction if the creator's
   initialization sentinel.  It is the very first check so no state can be
   written before it.

2. **Creator authentication** — `creator.require_auth()` is called before any
   storage write.  The Soroban host rejects the transaction if the creator's
   signature is absent or invalid.

3. **Goal floor** — `goal >= 1` prevents zero-goal campaigns that could be
   immediately drained by the creator.

4. **Minimum contribution floor** — `min_contribution >= 1` prevents
   zero-amount contributions that waste gas and pollute storage.

5. **Deadline offset** — `deadline >= now + 60s` ensures the campaign is live
   for at least one ledger close interval, preventing dead-on-arrival campaigns.

6. **Platform fee cap** — `fee_bps <= 10_000` ensures the platform can never
   be configured to take more than 100% of raised funds.

7. **Bonus goal ordering** — `bonus_goal > goal` prevents a bonus goal that is
   already met at launch, which would immediately emit a bonus event and confuse
   contributors.

8. **Atomic write ordering** — All validations complete before the first
   `env.storage().instance().set()` call. A failed validation leaves the
   contract in its pre-initialization state.

9. **Description length validation** — Bonus goal description length is
   validated to prevent unbounded state growth that could increase storage
   costs and impact contract performance.

   `env.storage().instance().set()` call.  A failed validation leaves the
   contract in its pre-initialization state.

---

## Constraints

- `initialize()` can only be called once per contract instance. The factory
- `initialize()` can only be called once per contract instance.  The factory
  contract deploys a fresh instance per campaign.
- The `admin` and `creator` may be the same address or different addresses.
  The contract does not enforce a relationship between them.
- `bonus_goal_description` has no length limit enforced at the contract level.
  The frontend should enforce a reasonable display limit (e.g. 280 characters).
- The `initialized` event is emitted after all storage writes. If the
- The `initialized` event is emitted after all storage writes.  If the
  transaction is rolled back for any reason, the event is not persisted.

## Security notes

- **One-time call**: The guard `env.storage().instance().has(&DataKey::Creator)` prevents re-initialization. Any subsequent call returns `Err(ContractError::AlreadyInitialized)`.
- **Creator auth**: `creator.require_auth()` is called unconditionally, ensuring the transaction must be signed by the creator's key.
- **Admin separation**: `admin` and `creator` can be different addresses. The admin is only used for contract upgrades; the creator manages the campaign lifecycle.
- **No arithmetic in initialize**: All values are stored as-is. No overflow risk at this stage.
- **Platform fee cap**: A fee above 10 000 bps would allow the platform to drain the entire campaign. The hard cap prevents misconfiguration.
- **Bonus goal ordering**: Enforcing `bonus_goal > goal` prevents a bonus goal that is already met at launch.

The `crowdfund_initialize_function` module exposes a standalone validation function that can be used before calling `initialize`:

```rust
use crowdfund::crowdfund_initialize_function::{
    validate_initialization_params, InitError,
};

let result = validate_initialization_params(
    &env,
    goal,
    deadline,
    min_contribution,
    Some(fee_bps),   // platform fee in bps, or None
    Some(bonus),     // bonus goal, or None
);

match result {
    Ok(()) => { /* safe to call initialize */ }
    Err(InitError::GoalNotPositive)            => { /* handle */ }
    Err(InitError::DeadlineInPast)             => { /* handle */ }
    Err(InitError::MinContributionNotPositive) => { /* handle */ }
    Err(InitError::MinContributionExceedsGoal) => { /* handle */ }
    Err(InitError::PlatformFeeExceedsMax)      => { /* handle */ }
    Err(InitError::BonusGoalNotGreaterThanGoal)=> { /* handle */ }
}
```
