//! # Admin Upgrade Mechanism
//!
//! This module provides a secure and auditable mechanism for upgrading smart contract
//! WASM code. It ensures that only authorized administrators can perform upgrades,
//! while maintaining full transparency and audit capabilities through event emissions.
//!
//! ## Security Features
//!
//! - **Authentication**: All upgrade operations require admin authentication via `require_auth()`
//! - **Atomic Operations**: Upgrades are atomic - they either succeed completely or fail
//! - **Event Audit Trail**: All upgrade operations emit events for off-chain monitoring
//! - **Admin Verification**: Contract prevents upgrades before initialization
//! - **Separation of Concerns**: Admin role is distinct from campaign creator role

//! @title   AdminUpgradeMechanism — Restricted WASM upgrade logic for the
//!          crowdfund contract.
//!
//! @notice  This module exposes a single entry point, `upgrade()`, that
//!          replaces the contract's on-chain WASM binary with a new version
//!          identified by its SHA-256 hash.  The call is gated behind a strict
//!          `admin.require_auth()` check — only the address stored as `Admin`
//!          during `initialize()` may invoke it.
//!
//! @dev     ## Centralized upgradeability — risks and mitigations
//!
//!          Upgradeable contracts introduce a trust assumption: whoever controls
//!          the admin key controls the contract logic.  Risks include:
//!
//!          1. **Key compromise** — If the admin's private key is stolen, an
//!             attacker can deploy arbitrary WASM, potentially draining all
//!             contributor funds or redirecting withdrawals.
//!             *Mitigation*: use a multisig or governance contract as admin,
//!             never a plain EOA.
//!
//!          2. **Malicious upgrade** — A rogue admin (or compromised multisig
//!             signer) could push WASM that removes refund logic or changes
//!             the withdrawal recipient.
//!             *Mitigation*: time-lock upgrades and require off-chain review
//!             before execution; publish the WASM source and verify the hash.
//!
//!          3. **Irreversibility** — Once `update_current_contract_wasm` is
//!             called the old WASM is gone.  There is no built-in rollback.
//!             *Mitigation*: test the new WASM on testnet, verify storage
//!             compatibility, and keep the old WASM hash for reference.
//!
//!          4. **Storage layout drift** — A new WASM that changes `DataKey`
//!             variants or storage types can corrupt existing state.
//!             *Mitigation*: treat storage layout as a public API; add new
//!             keys rather than changing existing ones.
//!
//! ## Upgrade flow
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. Build new WASM  →  cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
//! 2. Upload WASM     →  stellar contract install --wasm <file> --network testnet
//!                        returns <WASM_HASH> (32-byte hex)
//! 3. Call upgrade()  →  stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT> -- upgrade
//!                        --new_wasm_hash <WASM_HASH>
//!                        (must be signed by the admin key)
//! ```
