//! contribute() error handling — typed errors and diagnostic helpers.
//!
//! @title   ContributeErrorHandling
//! @notice  Centralizes error codes and helpers for the `contribute()` entry
//!          point. All error conditions are represented as typed `ContractError`
//!          variants; this module re-exports their numeric codes so off-chain
//!          scripts can map raw codes to human-readable descriptions without
//!          embedding magic numbers.
//!
//! # Error taxonomy for `contribute()`

//! | Code | Variant              | Trigger                                          |
//! |------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
//! |  2   | `CampaignEnded`      | `ledger.timestamp > deadline`                    |
//! |  6   | `Overflow`           | contribution or total_raised would overflow      |
//! |  8   | `ZeroAmount`         | `amount == 0`                                    |
//! |  9   | `BelowMinimum`       | `amount < min_contribution`                      |
//! | 10   | `CampaignNotActive`  | campaign status is not `Active`                  |
//! | 11   | `NegativeAmount`     | `amount < 0`                                     |
//!
//! # Security assumptions
//!
//! - `contributor.require_auth()` is called before any state mutation.
//! - Negative amounts are rejected before zero/minimum checks.
//! - Campaign status is checked first; cancelled/succeeded campaigns are
//!   rejected before any other validation.
//! - Overflow is caught with `checked_add` on both per-contributor and global totals.
//! - The deadline check uses strict `>`, so contributions at exactly the
//!   deadline timestamp are accepted.

/// Numeric error codes returned by the contract host for `contribute()`.
///
/// These mirror the `#[repr(u32)]` values of `ContractError` and are intended
/// for use in off-chain scripts that inspect raw error codes.
//! contribute() error handling — reviewed and hardened.
//! contribute() error handling — deprecates old panic-based logic.
//! contribute() error handling — typed errors replacing old panic-based logic.
//!
//! All previously untyped panics in `contribute()` are now returned as typed
//! `ContractError` variants, enabling scripts and CI/CD pipelines to handle
//! errors programmatically.

//! # Deprecation notice
//!
//! The following panic-based guards have been **deprecated** and replaced with
//! typed errors:
//!
//! - `panic!("amount below minimum")` → `ContractError::BelowMinimum` (code 9)
//! - implicit zero-amount pass-through → `ContractError::ZeroAmount` (code 8)
//! - no status guard → `ContractError::CampaignNotActive` (code 10)
//! contribute() error handling — constants, helpers, and off-chain utilities.

//! # Security assumptions
//!
//! - `contributor.require_auth()` is called before any state mutation.
//! - Negative amounts are rejected before zero/minimum checks to prevent
//!   token-level panics or unexpected transfer behaviour.
//! - Token transfer happens before storage writes; failures roll back atomically.
//! - Overflow is caught with `checked_add` on both per-contributor and global totals.
//! - The deadline check uses strict `>`, so contributions at exactly the deadline
//!   timestamp are accepted.
//! - Campaign status is checked first, so cancelled/successful campaigns are
//!   rejected before any other validation.
//! - Token transfer happens before storage writes; if the transfer fails the
//!   transaction rolls back atomically — no partial state is persisted.
//! - Overflow is caught with `checked_add` on both the per-contributor total
//!   and `total_raised`, returning `ContractError::Overflow` rather than
//!   wrapping silently.
//! - The deadline check uses strict `>`, so a contribution at exactly the
//!   deadline timestamp is accepted — scripts should account for this boundary.
