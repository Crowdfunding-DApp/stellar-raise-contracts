//! # Admin Upgrade Mechanism
//!
//! This module provides a secure and auditable mechanism for upgrading smart contract
//! WASM code. It ensures that only authorized administrators can perform upgrades,
//! while maintaining full transparency and audit capabilities through event emissions.
//!
//! ## Security Features
//!
//! - **Authentication**: All upgrade operations require admin authentication via `require_auth()`
//! - **Atomic Operations**: Upgrades are atomic - they either succeed completely or fail
//! - **Event Audit Trail**: All upgrade operations emit events for off-chain monitoring
//! - **Admin Verification**: Contract prevents upgrades before initialization
//! - **Separation of Concerns**: Admin role is distinct from campaign creator role
